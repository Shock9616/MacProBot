## Running For Yourself

This bot is entirely focused on being useful for MacProTips' "Mac Gaming"
discord server, but if you find yourself wanting to try it for yourself, here's
how to do it:

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shock9616/MacProBot
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment in repository root (optional but
   _HIGHLY_ recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create necessary environment variables in a file called `.env` in the root of
   the repository with the following contents (replace `<>` with required
   value):

```
TOKEN = <DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN>
AI_API_KEY = <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>
ANNOUNCEMENTS_CHANNEL_ID = <1234567890>
MOD_CHANNEL_ID = <1234567890>
WALLPAPERS_CHANNEL_ID = <1234567890>
```

- `TOKEN` is the secret key that is used to connect to discord. To get this
  token, you need to create an application on the
  [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- `AI_API_KEY` Is used to connect to an LLM on OpenRouter for unprompted
  responses. This is not necessary to run the bot, but the AI responses will not
  work without it
- `ANNOUNCEMENTS_CHANNEL_ID`, `MOD_CHANNEL_ID`, and `WALLPAPERS_CHANNEL_ID` are
  the unique identifiers for the channels used for the `/announce` and
  `/wallpaper` commands. These aren't necessary to run the bot, but the commands
  won't work without them

5. Run the bot

```bash
python main.py
```
